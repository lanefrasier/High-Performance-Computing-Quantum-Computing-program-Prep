# High Performance Computing / Quantum Computing Program Prep

Welcome to my personal learning repository. This project documents my self-guided preparation for applying to a Master’s program in **High Performance Computing** and **Quantum Computing**. It includes handwritten note conversions, markdown study guides, key derivations, visual explanations, and a final showcase project.

I created this repository to:
- Deepen my understanding of foundational concepts
- Track my progress systematically
- Showcase my initiative and technical growth

## About Me

I’ve always had a restless curiosity about **how** things work and, more importantly, **why** they work. Digging into the deeper questions gives me clarity and a solid foundation for real-world applications, which is why I majored in pure mathematics for my undergraduate degree. 

Mathematics offers a universal lens. From the principle axioms, entire worlds of math can be extrapolated. As innovation and technology accelerate, I’m eager to help elevate that foundation into more advanced areas. **Quantum computing captivates me precisely because it once looked impossible.** That seeming impossibility fuels my drive to explore, understand, and ultimately contribute meaningful advances to the field.
