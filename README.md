# High Performance Computing / Quantum Computing Program Prep

Welcome to my personal learning repository. This project documents my self-guided preparation for applying to a Master’s program in **High Performance Computing** and **Quantum Computing**. It includes handwritten note conversions, markdown study guides, key derivations, visual explanations, and a final showcase project.

I created this repository to:
- Deepen my understanding of foundational concepts
- Track my progress systematically
- Showcase my initiative and technical growth
